## Introduction

### What is JavaScript?

- It is created by the Brendan Eich
- Initially for adding simple interactivity in Netscape browser.
- Important core technology like HTML, CSS in Web App Development.

### Where does it run?

- **Browser** - Client Side Scripting (Interactivity, DOM updates)
- **Node.js** - Server Side Scripting (backend apps, APIs)
- **Cross Platform** (desktop, mobile, IoT with framework)

### Basic Web Dev Analogy

- **HTML** - Structure (headings, paragraphs, buttons)
- **CSS** - Styling (colors, layout, animations)
- **JS** - Behavior (click actions, form validation, dynamic content)

## Basic of JavaScript

### Variables

- **var** – used in old javascript code till 2015.
- **let** - Introduced in 2015, declared before use, cant redeclared in same scope.
- **const** – Introduced in 2015, cant be Redeclared, Reassigned, have Block Scope

### When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

## Basic of JavaScript

### Datatypes

- **String** - “Apexaiq”
- **Number** - 25, 3.14
- **Boolean** - true, false
- **Null** - intentional empty value
- **Undefined** - declared but not assigned
- **Object** - collection of key-value pairs
- **Arrays** - collection of the ordered of different type

### Operators

- **Arithmetic** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison** `==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`
- **Logical** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Assignment** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

- **if** - to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- **else** - to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- **else if** - to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- **Switch** - to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

### Loops

- **for** - loops through a block of code a number of times
- **for/in** - loops through the properties of an object
- **for/of** - loops through the values of any iterable
- **while** - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- **do/while** - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

## Function

### What is Function?

- A block of code designed to perform a task
- Runs only when it is called/invoked
- Helps in reusing code

### Key Points

- **Parameters** - input values
- **Return** - output value
- **Scope**:
  - Global (accessible everywhere)
  - Local (inside function)
  - Block (inside `{ }` with let/const)

## Function

### Type of Function

1. **Function Declaration (Named Function)**
   - Defined with the function keyword
   - Hoisted - can be called before declaration

2. **Function Expression**
   - Function stored in a variable
   - Not hoisted - can only be used after definition

3. **Arrow Function (ES6)**
   - Shorter syntax using `=>`
   - Does not have its own `this`
   - (important in objects & classes)

4. **Anonymous Function**
   - Function without a name (often used as a callback)

5. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**
   - Runs automatically after being defined

6. **Higher-Order Function**
   - A function that takes another function as argument or returns a function

7. **Recursive Function**
   - A function that calls itself

## Array

### What is an Array?

- An ordered list of values (like a container for multiple items).
- Can store numbers, strings, objects, even functions.

### Array Properties & Methods

- `.length` → total items
- `.push()` → add at end
- `.pop()` → remove from end
- `.shift()` → remove first item
- `.unshift()` → add at start
- `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` → for processing

## Objects

### What is Objects?

- A collection of key-value pairs
- Keys are properties (always strings or symbols)
- Values can be anything (string, number, array, function, object)

### Features provided by object

- Accessing Properties
- Adding / Updating Properties
- Deleting Properties
- Methods (Functions inside Objects)
- Built-in Object Methods

## DOM

### What is DOM?

- The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
- It represents the page structure as a tree of nodes (elements, attributes, text, etc.).
- JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change the page content, style, or structure dynamically.

### Why DOM is important?

- Lets us change content dynamically (e.g., update text, images).
- Enables interaction with users (like clicking buttons, filling forms).
- Helps in creating dynamic websites instead of static ones.

### DOM Manipulation Methods

- Selecting elements
- Changing content
- Changing style
- Creating new elements

## Event Handling

### What is an Event?

- An event is an action that happens in the browser (e.g., a user clicks a button, presses a key, or moves the mouse).
- JavaScript can "listen" for these events and respond to them.

### Common Types of Events

- `onclick` - when a user clicks an element
- `onmouseover` - when the mouse is over an element
- `onkeydown` / `onkeyup` - when a key is pressed or released
- `onsubmit` - when a form is submitted
- `onchange` - when the value of input changes

## Callback

### What is Callback?

- A function passed as an argument to another function.
- Allows one function to call another function later.
- Useful for tasks that take time (like reading files, API calls).
- Makes code more flexible & reusable.

### Why we use Callback?

- **Reusability** → We can change the callback without touching the main function.
- **Async Handling** → Used to wait for tasks (like API requests, file reading).
- **Control Flow** → Defines what should happen after a task is complete.

## Promise

### What is Promise?

- A special JavaScript object used for handling asynchronous operations.
- Represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.
- Has 3 states:
  - **Pending** → waiting for result
  - **Fulfilled** → operation successful (resolved)
  - **Rejected** → operation failed (error)

### Why use Promises?

- Avoids Callback Hell → no deeply nested callbacks.
- Cleaner async handling with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- Chainable → run multiple async operations in sequence.

## Async and Await

### What is it?

- Async/Await is syntax built on top of Promises.
- Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.
- Helps write code that is cleaner, easier to read, and debug.
- **async** → tells JavaScript that the function will return a Promise.
- **await** → pauses the function until the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.

### Why use Async and Await?

- Cleaner code → looks like step-by-step instructions.
- Avoids chaining `.then()` → no more promise nesting.
- Easy error handling → use `try...catch`.
- Best practice → modern way of handling async tasks

## Closures

### What is closures?

- A function that remembers variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
- Created automatically whenever a function is defined inside another function.
- Helps in data hiding, encapsulation, and creating private variables.

### Why use Closures?

- **Data Privacy** → Variables stay hidden & can’t be accessed directly.
- **Encapsulation** → Only specific functions can use the hidden variables.
- **Stateful Functions** → Useful for counters, caching, event handlers, etc.
- **Functional Programming** → Forms the base of many advanced JS patterns.
